## About
This "project" if you would like to call it that is supposed to give me a learning oportunity on the library SDL and more generaly native game development. I tried making a simple clone of the famous "Space Invaders" game, developed by Taito.

As you can see from the image, it doesn't feature all that much, however, I am willing to continue working on it but for now this is it.

## How to play
You can move using the 'left' and 'right' arrow keys and fire a projectile by pressing 'space'.

I have taken some creative liberties and thus gameplay is not the same as the original, the objective is to try to live as long as possible through a repeating sequence of levels and kill as many aliens as possible. When they reach you, you instantly loose the game and start over.

## Contributing
You can edit the code as you wish.
##### !!Note: The code itself is very, VERY bad and not at all well structured. I tried my best but that doesn't say much sadly.

In order to build it, you need the necesary SDL dlls and their respective c# bindings. These are: SDL, SDL_ttf, SDL_images. You can download the bindings from [here](https://github.com/flibitijibibo/SDL2-CS) and the dlls [here](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.32.8). Personally I used the Sayers.SDL2.Core NuGet package instead of downloading all of these but you can choose.
